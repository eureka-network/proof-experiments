# Semaphore example

This is meant as an exercise of the semaphore example the Plonky2 team presented at zkHack mini in H1 2022. The original code at github.com/mir-protocol/plonky2-semaphore, however as there is not yet an official release of plonky2, some minor changes to interfaces have been incorporated here, against a more recent snapshot of the Plonky2 repository.
